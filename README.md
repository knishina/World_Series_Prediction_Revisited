# World_Series_Prediction_Revisited

### Summary.
The purpose of this project is to build a model to predict the winner of the 2019 World Series. The data was scraped from the MLB and ESPN. The following modules were used analyze/visualize and build a predictive model: `pandas, numpy` for data munging, `matplotlib, seaborn` for visualization, `sklearn` for model building, and `HTML/CSS/Bootstrap` for front end.

- ```notebooks_for_data```  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Notebooks used for data scraping, cleaning, and visualization.
- ```notebooks_for_models```  &nbsp; Notebooks used to upsample data, scale, and generate models.
- ```css``` &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CSS for front-end, used by [index.html](https://github.com/knishina/World_Series_Prediction_Revisited/blob/master/index.html).

### Conclusion.
This project used a maximum of team data that includes statistics for hitting, pitching, and fielding.  The data were used to build a predictive model.  The SVC-grid model worked best and appeared to be fairly accurate.
