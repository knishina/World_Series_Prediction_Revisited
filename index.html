                    Last year, I made an attempt to predict the winner of the 2018 World Series (<a href="https://knishina.github.io/World_Series_Prediction/" target="blank">WS18</a>).  That model was built on only a few features, focusing only on statistically significant data that discerns the World Series winners from all other teams.  These features included: ERA, Runs, and WP (win percentage).  However, that model was a touch simplistic and not terribly accurate.  The goal this year is to build a robust model without narrowing the dataset.

                <h5>Controversy.</h5>
                <p class="text3">
                    Before diving into the data, however, there is a bit of controversy that must be addressed.  This concerns the definition of the "modern era" of baseball.  There are two years that could be posited as the start of the "modern era": 1905 and 1969.
                </p>

                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>1905.</strong></p>
                <p class="text3" style="margin: 0px;"></p>
                    While the available data reaches back to 1876, it wasn't until 1905 that annual World Series were held.  In 1905, there were significant rule changes.  These included foul balls counted as strikes, RBIs and ERAs were tracked, the mound was moved further back (allowing for breaking balls), and spitballs were made illegal.
                </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>1969.</strong></p>
                <p class="text3" style="margin-top: 0px;">
                    The reason for the 1969 start date is due to significant rule changes that are more similar to current baseball rules.  For example, 1969 marked the first year of division play and the expanded postseason, the strike zone shrinking, and the lowering of the pitcher's mound by five inches.  All of these changes result in very different metrics posted by each team.

                    Two datasets will be obtained.  The first will include regular season data from 1905-2019; the second will include data from 1969-2019.  All statistics from hitting, fielding, and pitching will be included in the dataset, with the exception of calculated features.

                    A number of different models were tested against the 1905-2019 dataset and the 1969-2019 dataset.  As I tested these models, I ran into a problem of unbalanced data.  There were far more not-winners of the World Series compared to actual winners of the World Series.  Therefore, the models would be overfitted for not-winners and produce complete junk for predictions of the validation set.

                        Upsample the dataset, scale the features, and split into train and test sets.  With upsampling, there are a number ratios of not-winners to winners that were tried (ie: 1:1, 1:0.5, 1:0.25).<br/>

                            I tried a number of different models.  Oftentimes, they were overfitted and produced pure junk.  However, there was one model that worked fairly well.  This was a grid-search with SVC.<br/>

                            With the SVC-grid model, all three upsampling conditions yielded appropriate results for 2018 and 2017.  I am disregarding 2016 simply because the winner of 2016 was the Cubs.  (And it's the Cubs.)  It was an improbable win based on the heart of the team (something that cannot be measured by a statistic!)  I will give credit to models that give the Indians for 2016 as they made it to the World Series in 2016.<br/>
