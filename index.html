                <p class="text3">
                    Last year, I made an attempt to predict the winner of the 2018 World Series (<a href="https://knishina.github.io/World_Series_Prediction/" target="blank">WS18</a>).  That model was built on only a few features, focusing only on statistically significant data that discerns the World Series winners from all other teams.  These features included: ERA, Runs, and WP (win percentage).  However, that model was a touch simplistic and not terribly accurate.  The goal this year is to build a robust model without narrowing the dataset.

                <h5>Controversy.</h5>
                <p class="text3">
                    Before diving into the data, however, there is a bit of controversy that must be addressed.  This concerns the definition of the "modern era" of baseball.  There are two years that could be posited as the start of the "modern era": 1905 and 1969.
                </p>

                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>1905.</strong></p>
                <p class="text3" style="margin: 0px;"></p>
                    While the available data reaches back to 1876, it wasn't until 1905 that annual World Series were held.  In 1905, there were significant rule changes.  These included foul balls counted as strikes, RBIs and ERAs were tracked, the mound was moved further back (allowing for breaking balls), and spitballs were made illegal.
                </p>
                <p style="margin:0px;"><strong>1969.</strong></p>
                <p class="text3" style="margin-top: 0px;">
                    The reason for the 1969 start date is due to significant rule changes that are more similar to current baseball rules.  For example, 1969 marked the first year of division play and the expanded postseason, the strike zone shrinking, and the lowering of the pitcher's mound by five inches.  All of these changes result in very different metrics posted by each team.

                        These two graphs depict the ERA of each team during the regular season from 1905-2015 or from 1969-2015.  In both graphs, World Series winners are in blue, and non-winners are in red.  Both populations are large and have a somewhat normal distribution.  Means of each sample group (winners and non-winners) were calculated and compared.  A Z-Score was calculated, resulting in the determination of P-Values and confidence intervals.

                <h1>ML: Predicting the 2018 World Series Winner</h1>
                <p class="text3">
                    So far, the data indicate that win percentage, total runs, and ERA are significantly different when considering World Series winners and non-winners.  Additionally, the 1905 start point is not that much different than the 1969 start point when assessing P-values.  Therefore in building the ML model, win percentage, total runs, and ERA from 1905-2015 will be considered.
                </p>
                <p class="text3">
                    There were two models tested.  Initially, with Scikit-learn, the Random Forest model was used to evaluate the data.  The model yielded a 32.7% success rate, a 67.3% failure rate, and a 4.14% false-positive rate.  Due to the low success rate seen with the Random Forest model, a second model was utilized.  Using Logistic Regression, the following was found: 82.7% success rate, 17.3% failure rate, and 19% false positive rate.  The Logistic Regression model, while having a good success rate, had a very high false positive rate.  Given the two models, the Logistic Regression model appears to yield better results.
                </p>
                <p class="text3">
                    The model was trained on data from 1905-2015, and the model was tested on data from 2016 and 2017.  Data from 2016 yielded a successful test run where the prediction matched the actual outcome.  The model predicted the Cubs to win, and the actual outcome was that the Cubs won the World Series.  Interestingly, the total runs made by the Cubs during the regular season was the highest compared to other teams.  
                </p>
                <p class="text3">
                    Data from 2017 did not yeid a successful run.  The model predicted the Indians winning, while the actual outcome was the Astros winning the World Series.  As with the 2016 season, the total runs made by the Astros was the highest compared to other teams.  It may be the case that simply assessing the total runs in the regular season may be the metric to evaluate to determine the World Series winner.
                </p>
                <p class="text3" style="color:rgb(192, 57, 43)"><strong>
                    Given the current standings in the 2018 regular season, the model predicts the Astros to win the World Series.  This agrees with a prediction found on the MLB web site.  However, following the past trend of teams with the highest total runs winning the World Series, the Boston Red Sox might be poised to win it all.
